# myConnections

**myConnections** is a relationship-matching app inspired by the relationship smorgasbord used in polyamory. The app helps users explore and align their relationship preferences with their partners.

## Features

- **Account Creation & Partner Linking**: Users create an account and connect with their existing partners.
- **Relationship Aspect Cards**: Users swipe through different cards representing various relationship aspects and indicate their preferences.
- **Matching System**: A match screen displays aspects that both partners agree on, fostering better communication and understanding.

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account and set up your profile.
2. **Connect with Partners**: Link your profile with your partners' profiles.
3. **Swipe on Relationship Aspects**: Go through different cards representing aspects of relationships and swipe ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ based on your preferences.
4. **View Matches**: See the relationship aspects that you and your partner(s) both agreed on.
